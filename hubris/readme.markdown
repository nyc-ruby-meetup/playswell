Hubris for the win
======

## Description

Hubris is a bridge between Ruby and Haskell, between love and bondage,
between slothful indolence and raw, blazing speed. Hubris will wash
your car, lie to your boss, and salvage your love life. If you are 
very, very lucky, it might also let you get some functional goodness 
into your ruby programs through the back door.

### why its awesome 

its haskell

### why it sucks

1. Does not play nice with RVM (you need to point hubris toward your headers library headers in order to get this to work, yes I have files a ticket and if it is not resolved next week, I'll address it )
2. When you can get it installed, its a pain in the ass
3. can't use it on windows (this is of course considered a feature)

### installing it

best to install this on a virtual machine or a server with a fresh version of ubuntu or debian. If your running with a ruby install from apt then [this guide](https://github.com/mwotton/Hubris/wiki/Installation-on-a-fresh-install-of-Ubuntu-10.04-(Lucid-Lynx)) works
